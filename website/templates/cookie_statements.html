        <h1>COOKIES STATEMENT</h1>
        <div class="cookie_text">
            <p>Last updated: 19th May 2022 </p>>
            <p>This Cookie Statement explains
            how OpportunityM Ltd. (“OpportunityM,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) uses cookies
            and other similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our Sites or
            Applications ("Online Properties") and in the course of using any of our Services.
            It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control
            our use of them. Any capitalized terms that are not also defined in this Cookie
            Statement are defined in our Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>NOTE: To learn more about OpportunityM's Legal Terms, take a look here. For more
            information on OpportunityM’s privacy practises, refer to our full Privacy Policy here.</p>
            <h2 class="sub_title">What are cookies?</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device
            when you visit a website. The term “cookie” is used in this Cookie Statement in the broad sense
            to include cookies and all similar techniques and technologies, including web beacons. Web beacons
            (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs") are tiny graphics files that contain a unique
            identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Online Properties or taken an action
            in relation to our Online Properties.</p>
            <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, OpportunityM) are called "first-party cookies."
            Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party
            cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g.,
            advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognise
            your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
            For more information on cookies, go to allaboutcookies.org.</p>
            <h2 class="sub_title">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
            <p>OpportunityM uses first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required
            for technical reasons in order for our Online Properties to operate, and we refer to these as "essential"
            or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to better understand your use of our Online Properties,
            to track and target the interests of our Speakers, and to enhance the experience of Speakers on our Online Properties.
            Third parties serve cookies through our Online Properties for advertising, analytics and other purposes.<br><br>
            Organisers can also use cookies on our Online Property to learn more about your interests in their speaking event(s).
            These practises are described in more detail below.</p>
            <h2 class="sub_title">Types of cookies we use</h2>
            <h3 class="sub_para_title">First-party cookies</h3>
            <p>These cookies are created by OpportunityM. They are primarily used to
            allow you to browse our Online Properties and use their features. They
            may also assist us in our analytics activities. These cookies may use
            non-personal data (e.g., aggregate or de-identified information about your
            use of the Online Properties) or information that uniquely identifies the
            browser or device you are using to access the Online Properties.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_para_title">Third-party cookies</h3>
            <p>In addition to the first-party cookies we use, some third-party
            companies may place cookies on your computer through our Online Properties,
            access those cookies, and associate web beacons with them. These cookies enable
            third-party features or functionalities to be provided on or through our Online Properties.
            The parties that set these third-party cookies can use them to recognise your
            device both when it visits our Online Properties and also when it visits certain other, unaffiliated websites.</p>
            <h2 class="sub_title">Types of first- and third-party cookies we use</h2>
            <p>The types of first- and third-party cookies we use on our Online Properties are detailed below.
            Please note that the specific cookies served to your browser may vary depending on the specific Oliver
            McCourty Property you visit. These cookies may use non-personal data (e.g., aggregate or de-identified
            information about your use of the Online Properties) or information that uniquely identifies the browser
            or device you are using to access the Online Properties.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_para_title">First-party cookies</h3>
            <p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with access to and the basic use of our Services or
            Online Properties, such as access to secure areas and setting your privacy preferences. These cookies cannot be turned off.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_para_title">Performance and functionality cookies:</h3>
            <p>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Online Properties,
            but are not required for their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality
            of the Online Properties may become limited or unavailable.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_para_title">Analytics and customisation cookies:</h3>
            <p>These cookies help us understand how our Online Properties are being used or how effective
            our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customise our Sites for you. Thanks to this information,
            we are able to improve the features offered on our Online Properties.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_para_title">Targeting cookies:</h3>
            <p>These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions
            like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed
            for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_para_title">Social Media cookies:</h3>
            <p>These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our Online Properties
            through third-party social networking and other websites. These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_para_title">Organiser cookies:</h3>
            <p>Organisers selling tickets to events may use a variety of cookies on our Online Properties,
            including analytics and customisation cookies, advertising cookies, and social media cookies.
            They may use these cookies to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services in which
            you may be interested and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and marketing campaigns.
            Please note that OpportunityM does not have access to or control the cookies that organisers chose to use.</p>
            <p>For more information on how to allow or refuse these various types of cookies, please see “Cookie management” below.</p>
            <h2 class="sub_title">Duration of cookies stored on your device</h2>
            <p>The duration of storage of cookies on your device may vary, depending on the category to which they belong: temporary or permanent.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_para_title">Temporary cookies</h3>
            <p>We use temporary cookies on our Online Properties to allow you to browse our Online Properties without interruption.
            We may also use temporary cookies for internal reporting purposes. After your browsing session ends, this type of cookie
            does not store any information on your hard drive.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_para_title">Persistent cookies</h3>
            <p>Some of our first-party analytics cookies and certain third-party cookies are persistent cookies. They allow us and third
            parties to understand visitors’ browsing behaviour over a longer period of time, to provide you with additional features
            related to your use of the Online Properties, the content that you have saved or stored through them, as well as for advertising
            and marketing purposes. Depending on their function, this type of cookie may persist for different lengths of time ranging from
            several hours, to a week, or even several years. This type of cookie will persist after you end a browsing session and can be
            used by our Online Properties or third parties to recognise your device when you begin a new browsing session.</p>
            <h2 class="sub_title">Cookie management</h2>
            <p>If you want to control your cookie preferences, please follow the instructions below.</p>
            <p>Additionally, you have the option to adjust what cookies you allow us to place on your browser
            through our Cookie Settings tool. You can modify these settings at any time.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_para_title">All cookies:</h3>
            <p>You can exercise your preference to receive all types of cookies by managing cookies
            using your web browser settings. As the means by which you may allow or refuse cookies
            using browser settings varies from one web browser to another (e.g., Chrome, Safari, or Firefox),
            you should visit your web browser’s help menu for more information on setting your browser-based
            cookie preferences. You can also configure your browser at any time to be notified of the receipt
            of a cookie, so that you can decide whether you want to accept it or not.</p>
            <p>Cookies do not read other data on your hard drive, and you can delete them from your computer
            at any time using browser controls. At the moment, it is technically impossible for you to
            synchronise your settings between your browsers and your devices (your computer or your smartphone).
            You must set them on each browser/device that you currently use and each time you use a new browser
            or device. Please note that if you choose not to allow, or otherwise disable or deactivate all cookies,
            this will apply to all cookie types and will affect the functionality of our Online Properties. You may
            not be able to use all Site or Application features, and in some cases the OpportunityM
            Property simply will not perform.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_para_title">Analytics cookies:</h3>
            <p>To disable all analytics cookies managed by our third party analytics partners, please use
            the browser disablement mechanisms discussed immediately above. You can also use the following
            analytics opt out mechanisms provided by several of our analytics providers: </p>

            advertising or customise Google display network ads, visit the <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">Google Ads Settings</a> page.
            If you do not allow these cookies, you will still see advertising online,
